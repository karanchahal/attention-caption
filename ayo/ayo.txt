7/29/17, 13:10 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Hahaha , it's okay
7/29/17, 13:10 - Ayotakshee: (This is his favourite line even though he's not much older. He calls me a kid)
7/29/17, 13:11 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Random factzz
7/29/17, 13:11 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Does he play basketball ?
7/29/17, 13:11 - Ayotakshee: Nah
7/29/17, 13:11 - Ayotakshee: Cricket
7/29/17, 13:11 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: What does he like to do apart from that ?
7/29/17, 13:12 - Ayotakshee: Drink, haha
7/29/17, 13:13 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: That works
7/29/17, 13:13 - Ayotakshee: I'm just happy there are more people
7/29/17, 13:14 - Ayotakshee: Ldr people lol
7/29/17, 13:14 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Ldr - long distance relationship
7/29/17, 13:15 - Ayotakshee: Also lana del rey
7/29/17, 13:15 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Hahaha he likes Lana Del Rey ?
7/29/17, 13:15 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: That's awesome
7/29/17, 13:15 - Ayotakshee: Nahhhhh
7/29/17, 13:15 - Ayotakshee: Ldr ka full form bata rahi thi
7/29/17, 13:16 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Acha I thought both :p
7/29/17, 13:16 - Ayotakshee: Haha nah
7/29/17, 13:16 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: But yeah since they are working or just got out of college , a lot of people get into relationships or get out of relationships
7/29/17, 13:16 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I feel
7/29/17, 13:16 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Is that right ?
7/29/17, 13:17 - Ayotakshee: I don't know waise
7/29/17, 13:17 - Ayotakshee: Explain this?
7/29/17, 13:19 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: For example in my college during the last seen, people were hooking up left , right and center. And parting to their respective jobs with a promise of staying together . Seems like they are trying to hold on to some part of college or their previous life.
7/29/17, 13:19 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Maybe it's the same with your people too
7/29/17, 13:19 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: *last sem
7/29/17, 13:19 - Ayotakshee: Oh yeah, you told me this.
7/29/17, 13:19 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: So many new couples and some broke away wanting to start afresh
7/29/17, 13:20 - Ayotakshee: Yeahh I guess it could be true
7/29/17, 13:20 - Ayotakshee: But then again I think it's very circumstantial
7/29/17, 13:21 - Ayotakshee: Because those who are single probably have it easy. Because they can choose to start fresh or make the most of their last few days
7/29/17, 13:22 - Ayotakshee: But it's tougher for people in relationships I feel. Because it's like everything's put to test
7/29/17, 13:22 - Ayotakshee: You either grow stronger or break apart
7/29/17, 13:23 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: How do you get stronger ?
7/29/17, 13:25 - Ayotakshee: I think for me it's a threshold system
7/29/17, 13:25 - Ayotakshee: If you manage to stay for a while and work through the distance, there's no stopping you
7/29/17, 13:26 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Hmm , good to know
7/29/17, 13:27 - Ayotakshee: That's jus meh
7/29/17, 13:29 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I think I'll go downstairs now bub
7/29/17, 13:29 - Ayotakshee: Okay baby

7/29/17, 16:55 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: What happened, darling ?
7/29/17, 16:58 - Ayotakshee: Biatch didn't take my notebook (the assignment thing)

7/29/17, 16:58 - Ayotakshee: She has a lot of ego
7/29/17, 16:58 - Ayotakshee: (More than me)

8/6/17, 01:01 - Ayotakshee: I know

8/6/17, 01:03 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Do you generally freak out about long distance ?
8/6/17, 01:03 - Ayotakshee: Not long distance per se
8/6/17, 01:03 - Ayotakshee: I just have trust issues
8/6/17, 01:03 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: You do ?
8/6/17, 01:03 - Ayotakshee: *used to
8/6/17, 01:03 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I would never have known Ayo re
8/6/17, 01:04 - Ayotakshee: Haha aisa kyun
8/6/17, 01:04 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Nahi you never doubt me at what I'm doing or aren't  suspicious at all
8/6/17, 01:04 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Haha
8/6/17, 01:05 - Ayotakshee: That's the thing, I don't have them with you
8/6/17, 01:05 - Ayotakshee: Not one bit
8/6/17, 01:05 - Ayotakshee: I can't explain it, it's a vibe thing for me
8/6/17, 01:05 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Haan I did make my stance on that stuff very clear early on , so yeah. It must've been easier with me
8/6/17, 01:05 - Ayotakshee: Not really
8/6/17, 01:06 - Ayotakshee: That's not it
8/6/17, 01:06 - Ayotakshee: It's about genuineness I guess
8/6/17, 01:06 - Ayotakshee: Or what I perceive as genuine
8/6/17, 01:07 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Yes , you have nothing to worry about Ayo. I cannot play that hard
8/6/17, 01:08 - Ayotakshee: Oh you can play alrighttt
8/6/17, 01:08 - Ayotakshee: Don't underplay your charm kayy
8/6/17, 01:09 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Aur makhan , aur makhann
8/6/17, 01:09 - Ayotakshee: But even with all of this, I just didn't have that doubt in my head ever
8/6/17, 01:09 - Ayotakshee: Not makkhan :p
8/6/17, 01:09 - Ayotakshee: I'm just saying you're very playa
8/6/17, 01:12 - Ayotakshee: And the people I'd been with before, had all been playa bois. And I'd always doubted them/their intentions/their degree of liking towards me even when they said they really did care
8/6/17, 01:12 - Ayotakshee: Something about the vibe. I've always been cautious
8/6/17, 01:13 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: This is very interesting, tell me more
8/6/17, 01:13 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Pehle to define your concept of playa
8/6/17, 01:14 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Because I have a feeling your definition and my definition differ
8/6/17, 01:14 - Ayotakshee: Someone who knows his way around
8/6/17, 01:14 - Ayotakshee: Is good with girls
8/6/17, 01:14 - Ayotakshee: Good flirt
8/6/17, 01:15 - Ayotakshee: Says he loves you but probably still flirts with other women (with or without any intentions of things going anywhere)
8/6/17, 01:15 - Ayotakshee: Charm
8/6/17, 01:15 - Ayotakshee: Very charming
8/6/17, 01:15 - Ayotakshee: Good with words
8/6/17, 01:16 - Ayotakshee: Basically, -jaise tumko phasaaya, waise hi kitno ko hi phasaata hoga- wali soch
8/6/17, 01:16 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Aah what did these men do to you to get you to doubt them , Ayo re
8/6/17, 01:17 - Ayotakshee: Nah nothing they did baby boy
8/6/17, 01:17 - Ayotakshee: I suppose the problem lies in the core
8/6/17, 01:17 - Ayotakshee: I've never had well defined relationships
8/6/17, 01:17 - Ayotakshee: So there's always been that question in my head
8/6/17, 01:17 - Ayotakshee: What does he even want sorts
8/6/17, 01:18 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Did you ever try to clear it out with them ?
8/6/17, 01:18 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Black and white
8/6/17, 01:19 - Ayotakshee: I don't really remember
8/6/17, 01:19 - Ayotakshee: I think amrit was the only one I tried to with
8/6/17, 01:20 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I won't deny, that there are certain tricks of the trade.But it always changes after the first 3-4 days of new newness. Then it gets realer
8/6/17, 01:20 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Same with girls ,I feel
8/6/17, 01:20 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: These are not men, they're boys
8/6/17, 01:21 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Playas are people who when they like what they see , they go for it. So you know, girls can be playas too ha haa
8/6/17, 01:22 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: At least that's my definition
8/6/17, 01:23 - Ayotakshee: Yeah yeah girls can be playahs too
8/6/17, 01:23 - Ayotakshee: Agreed
8/6/17, 01:23 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: These are very common actually :P
8/6/17, 01:23 - Ayotakshee: I know
8/6/17, 01:23 - Ayotakshee: And there really isn't any harm waise toh
8/6/17, 01:23 - Ayotakshee: But phir wahi ek doubt hamesha rehta in your head
8/6/17, 01:24 - Ayotakshee: The 'what if'
8/6/17, 01:24 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Yeah, naah. I cannot even fathom the flirting
8/6/17, 01:24 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Maybe that's why I don't have a lot of female friends
8/6/17, 01:25 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Girls talk to me and then woh vibe se hi, they'll know. And phir it's just a casual friendship
8/6/17, 01:25 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I don't think I let them in
8/6/17, 01:25 - Ayotakshee: Maybe that's part of the vibe I got from you
8/6/17, 01:26 - Ayotakshee: When you told me this starting mein
8/6/17, 01:26 - Ayotakshee: That once you're in it you don't really try to even talk to other girls as such
8/6/17, 01:27 - Ayotakshee: I can't explain it
8/6/17, 01:27 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Haha good for you :P
8/6/17, 01:27 - Ayotakshee: I don't know
8/6/17, 01:27 - Ayotakshee: It didn't take me long to trust you
8/6/17, 01:28 - Ayotakshee: Which took me by surprise too
8/6/17, 01:29 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: You seemed like that too, kinda. At the trek you seemed like you wanted to join in but at the same time you were happy at being alone and in your space. And I really connected with that
8/6/17, 01:29 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: What took me by surprise was when we meet for the first time at C.P alone, how friendly and easy to talk to, you were
8/6/17, 01:30 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I felt I could talk to you for hours, the first day
8/6/17, 01:30 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Which is very very rare
8/6/17, 01:30 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: And then it just snowballed from there
8/6/17, 01:30 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: So vulnerable but strong
8/6/17, 01:31 - Ayotakshee: Did you kinda freak when I said you could come home even though my parents were there?
8/6/17, 01:31 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Haha, I was suprised that you offered
8/6/17, 01:31 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: But I was okay with it , if you were okay with it
8/6/17, 01:32 - Ayotakshee: Technically you offered it
8/6/17, 01:32 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Mera kya hi jaata Ayo :P
8/6/17, 01:32 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Oh haan
8/6/17, 01:32 - Ayotakshee: You said I could tune your guitar if your parents aren't home...
8/6/17, 01:32 - Ayotakshee: At that point i won't deny, I was like "......"
8/6/17, 01:32 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Yes I rememberr
8/6/17, 01:33 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Because it would have been easier for youuu
8/6/17, 01:33 - Ayotakshee: What would've been easier for me?
8/6/17, 01:33 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I didn't know your parents were cool
8/6/17, 01:33 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I assumed that you would have strict parents
8/6/17, 01:34 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: And if they weren't home , then I could come fix your guitar
8/6/17, 01:34 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Because I've a met a lot of girls who have very strict parents and they freak out
8/6/17, 01:34 - Ayotakshee: Haha wow
8/6/17, 01:34 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Isliye
8/6/17, 01:35 - Ayotakshee: Okay so I'll tell you what went through my head
8/6/17, 01:35 - Ayotakshee: (Geez you're either really playa or really naive)
8/6/17, 01:35 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Let's go with really playa
8/6/17, 01:36 - Ayotakshee: So obv the first thing that went through my mind was, "okay does he want to get in pants?"
8/6/17, 01:36 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: (Hey I could have brought condoms at the first Oyo room too btw )
8/6/17, 01:36 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I'm not tharki
8/6/17, 01:36 - Ayotakshee: Haaan toh first date yaar karann

8/6/17, 01:37 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Go on
8/6/17, 01:37 - Ayotakshee: But yeah that was the first thing that went through my heaf
8/6/17, 01:37 - Ayotakshee: Ki wow okay
8/6/17, 01:37 - Ayotakshee: "Guitar tuning" and all
8/6/17, 01:37 - Ayotakshee: Because I felt such an emphasis on "if your parents aren't home"
8/6/17, 01:37 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Were you excited at the prospect hmmm
8/6/17, 01:38 - Ayotakshee: Nah
8/6/17, 01:38 - Ayotakshee: I was trying to figure out at that time if I should ditch or not
8/6/17, 01:38 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Ohh fack
8/6/17, 01:38 - Ayotakshee: I'm not that kinda girl i guess
8/6/17, 01:38 - Ayotakshee: After that when i said "they are, but you can still come over if you want to"
8/6/17, 01:39 - Ayotakshee: You went all uhm are you sure?
8/6/17, 01:39 - Ayotakshee: And then later agreed, so I thought okay maybe he's not entirely a playah
8/6/17, 01:39 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Oh wow, I could have fucked that up very badly thinking back on it
8/6/17, 01:40 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Shit
8/6/17, 01:40 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I need to learn how to communicate better
8/6/17, 01:41 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: But yeah

8/6/17, 01:44 - Ayotakshee: Like I didn't know what I was going to do
8/6/17, 01:45 - Ayotakshee: And then you hugged me
8/6/17, 01:45 - Ayotakshee: And I knew I didn't have to think anymore
8/6/17, 01:45 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I would have shaken hands lol, if we hadn't held hands earlier
8/6/17, 01:45 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: A tight grasp
8/6/17, 01:46 - Ayotakshee: Nah I probably would've made a joke of it and hugged you
8/6/17, 01:46 - Ayotakshee: Like a friendly hug
8/6/17, 01:46 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Haha and I would be kicking myself for trying to shake your hand
8/6/17, 01:46 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: On the way back
8/6/17, 01:46 - Ayotakshee: I think I would've looked down at your hand and said "really?"
8/6/17, 01:47 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Haha no you wouldn't have
8/6/17, 01:47 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: It's. It not a hand shake like you think

8/16/17, 21:04 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: On the way down
8/16/17, 21:05 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I met two of the HR's in the lift

8/26/17, 00:48 - Ayotakshee: We would have for sure, but it would've been  super strenuous
8/26/17, 00:49 - Ayotakshee: (We will always figure it out, you know that right?)
8/26/17, 00:49 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Yes

8/26/17, 00:50 - Ayotakshee: (Thank god you did)
8/26/17, 00:50 - Ayotakshee: Because I then checked my WhatsApp and the class rep was asking where all the presentations were (in CAPS LOCK)
8/26/17, 00:50 - Ayotakshee: SO SHE WAS MAD
8/26/17, 00:51 - Ayotakshee: And I was supposed to mail the presentation. And I'd fallen asleep while making my bit
8/26/17, 00:52 - Ayotakshee: So I quickly made mine in 10 mins and sent the entire thing
8/26/17, 00:52 - Ayotakshee: By this time it was 8:45
8/26/17, 00:52 - Ayotakshee: And I had the oral presentation for the same at 9
8/26/17, 00:52 - Ayotakshee: So after that I just changed into formals and ran for class
8/26/17, 00:53 - Ayotakshee: I apologised to the team later because it was my fault
8/26/17, 00:53 - Ayotakshee: But yeah our presentation went okay

9/7/17, 19:51 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Ohhh
9/7/17, 19:51 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: So you wrote his argument
9/7/17, 19:51 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Hahahaha
9/7/17, 19:51 - Ayotakshee: Anywayy so woh sab hua
9/7/17, 19:51 - Ayotakshee: Nah just told him his part of the case. Like I was the agent for a soprano singer
9/7/17, 19:52 - Ayotakshee: And he was the manager of the opera company
9/7/17, 19:52 - Ayotakshee: And blah blah blah
9/7/17, 19:52 - Ayotakshee: Basic story line
9/7/17, 19:52 - Ayotakshee: So that all he had to do was come here and read up the facts and figures
9/7/17, 19:52 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Oh that's pretty interesting actually
9/7/17, 19:52 - Ayotakshee: Yep it actually is
9/7/17, 19:54 - Ayotakshee: It like the basic story is- there's an opera company which recently let go of their lead singer. Their show is due in 3 weeks. My client used to sing with this company since long. But with age, she started getting secondary parts and younger people were being taken for lead
9/7/17, 19:55 - Ayotakshee: But now the director told my client that he wants her to play the lead. Now my client actually wouldn't mind doing it for free because she's been out of the spotlight and will love simply the fame and limelight
9/7/17, 19:56 - Ayotakshee: Apart from this figures were given. Like tickets ke cost. And 2000 seater auditorium. And that when my client played lead 4 years back tab she was paid 22000$ and now after inflation rates would easily have doubled
9/7/17, 19:57 - Ayotakshee: And that last year's young lead was paid itna and secondary singers paid itna
9/7/17, 19:57 - Ayotakshee: And basically as the agent, mujhe deal karna tha with the manager of the company
9/7/17, 19:59 - Ayotakshee: (Similarly manager ke sheet par basic story line thi with other bits of information that I don't know. Like he didn't know that my client was actually willing to work for free. So stuff like if he hires a new singer he can pay max 45000 and things like this that I didn't know)
9/7/17, 19:59 - Ayotakshee: Soo ya. Might sound confuzzling but it was pretty interesting. And I totally looted him lol
9/7/17, 19:59 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Hahahahahahahhaa
9/7/17, 20:00 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I kinda get it
9/7/17, 20:00 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Damm
9/7/17, 20:00 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: That's sounds funn
9/7/17, 20:00 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: In front of everyone ?
9/7/17, 20:00 - Ayotakshee: Nah
9/7/17, 20:01 - Ayotakshee: We were asked to come in 3 slots
9/7/17, 20:01 - Ayotakshee: We were the last team in slot one
9/7/17, 20:01 - Ayotakshee: So v few people left in class
9/7/17, 20:01 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: So these sessions, were they marked by those foreign teachers ?
9/7/17, 20:01 - Ayotakshee: Nah
9/7/17, 20:01 - Ayotakshee: This was marked by the Indian one
9/7/17, 20:02 - Ayotakshee: Also. What was even better for me is that this is actually on the lines of what I want to do
9/7/17, 20:02 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Negotiation ? Hey,  I didn't know that

9/10/17, 21:22 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: What're you eatin'
9/10/17, 21:23 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: And even on weekdays the timings are way too stringent. Its 9:00 pm on paper but most shops start closing as early as 7:00 pm and the others stop serving half the items on menu.

Even the laundry guy stops allowing us even before the official time which was communicated to us. And the fact we basically have to climb up and down a hill to even get to it adds insult to injury.

Even the doctor leaves by 5 and thats when our training ends 

Same is with sports facilities, gym and pool. Closed on weekends and on weekdays its till 7:30.


I really like the facilities provided, but i wish we actually could use them on a daily basis.

Its always a race for us to get everything done by 7:30 pm
9/10/17, 21:23 - Ayotakshee: Naan and chhole
9/10/17, 21:23 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Ahahahahaha

9/12/17, 23:10 - Ayotakshee: They're okay
9/12/17, 23:10 - Ayotakshee: My naani is always sad tho
9/12/17, 23:10 - Ayotakshee: Family drama
9/12/17, 23:11 - Ayotakshee: Before hanging up we usually say "shaabdhaane theko" which literal translates to saavdhan se rehna but means "keep well" or something of that sort
9/12/17, 23:13 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: What family drama happened ?
9/12/17, 23:14 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Did they not say it this time around ?
9/12/17, 23:14 - Ayotakshee: And whenever I say this, she always says haaaan, jab tak zinda hun  blah blah blah
9/12/17, 23:15 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Oh ://
9/12/17, 23:15 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Does she live alone ?
9/12/17, 23:16 - Ayotakshee: Similar scene to yours
9/12/17, 23:16 - Ayotakshee: Nope
9/12/17, 23:16 - Ayotakshee: Maama
9/12/17, 23:16 - Ayotakshee: And mami and their 2 kidz (my cousins)
9/12/17, 23:16 - Ayotakshee: But the equation isn't great now between maami and naani
9/12/17, 23:17 - Ayotakshee: And hence maama and maami and maama and naani either
9/12/17, 23:17 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Why ?
9/12/17, 23:17 - Ayotakshee: And now she feels like a liability and they also think of her as a liability
9/12/17, 23:17 - Ayotakshee: Mainly this and just each side just getting bitchier
9/12/17, 23:18 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Mamma ka equation isn't good with Mami and Nani now ?
9/12/17, 23:18 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Ah fuck  , they should never let her feel that
9/12/17, 23:19 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Even if it might be true to some extent
9/12/17, 23:20 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: This is pretty intense
9/12/17, 23:21 - Ayotakshee: Yeah
9/12/17, 23:21 - Ayotakshee: It's sad
9/12/17, 23:21 - Ayotakshee: We do what we can from here
9/12/17, 23:21 - Ayotakshee: But kitna hi damage control kar lenge
9/12/17, 23:21 - Ayotakshee: I used to talk to her on the phone everyday
9/12/17, 23:21 - Ayotakshee: Also her memory is all ded now
9/12/17, 23:22 - Ayotakshee: So she asks me the same things everyday
9/12/17, 23:22 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: She's old now re
9/12/17, 23:23 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Does she have friends ?
9/12/17, 23:23 - Ayotakshee: Yep
9/12/17, 23:23 - Ayotakshee: My mom gets irritated at this sometimes
9/12/17, 23:23 - Ayotakshee: And I tell her this all the time
9/12/17, 23:23 - Ayotakshee: Yeah but she doesn't like getting out of the house
9/12/17, 23:23 - Ayotakshee: Because she can't walk a lot
9/12/17, 23:23 - Ayotakshee: So she's pretty much alone all the time
9/12/17, 23:24 - Ayotakshee: It's insanity
9/12/17, 23:25 - Ayotakshee: My mom keeps telling me that once they (mamma and papa) get old, unko old age home bhejne ko

9/12/17, 23:26 - Ayotakshee: They're practical
9/12/17, 23:27 - Ayotakshee: But I don't think they'll be a problem so I keep telling her baad ka baad mein dekhenge
9/12/17, 23:28 - Ayotakshee: She thinks she'll become like naani and she doesn't want me to go through what she had to go through
9/12/17, 23:28 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Your mom thinks too much
9/12/17, 23:29 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: My grandparents live in their own and they're pushing 86 now

9/12/17, 23:31 - Ayotakshee: Yes baby
9/12/17, 23:31 - Ayotakshee: Last resort of course
9/12/17, 23:32 - Ayotakshee: The old age home
9/12/17, 23:32 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Hamari family is also pretty nuclear like we don't believe in joint families as much.
9/12/17, 23:32 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Like staying independently with your own social circle is best
9/12/17, 23:33 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: We haven't arrived at a situation where this isn't feasible. So I dunno what will happen then
9/12/17, 23:33 - Ayotakshee: I think my mom would love the big family and everyone living close by etc
9/12/17, 23:33 - Ayotakshee: But yeah since she set out to work pretty early, she's always been independent
9/12/17, 23:33 - Ayotakshee: And then papa

9/21/17, 03:04 - Ayotakshee: I hadn't thought about it till you asked me
9/21/17, 03:05 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I just don't think it's healthy to not talk about it
9/21/17, 03:05 - Ayotakshee: We can talk about it
9/21/17, 03:05 - Ayotakshee: I don't have a problem with that
9/21/17, 03:06 - Ayotakshee: I just haven't thought about it in the last few days to be honest
9/21/17, 03:06 - Ayotakshee: (I was just being honest with you)
9/21/17, 03:06 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: It's been at the back of my head for a while
9/21/17, 03:07 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: How do you feel about it?
9/21/17, 03:07 - Ayotakshee: It's scary
9/21/17, 03:07 - Ayotakshee: But I don't get why or how 2 tests can be negative
9/21/17, 03:07 - Ayotakshee: I'm happy about it but it's almost like I'm still not sure
9/21/17, 03:08 - Ayotakshee: But I don't want to go to a doctor
9/21/17, 03:08 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Yeah , what is the error rate on those things?
9/21/17, 03:08 - Ayotakshee: I don't like doctors or hospitals
9/21/17, 03:08 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I know bub
9/21/17, 03:08 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Won't it be better with me, though?

9/21/17, 03:17 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: And worrying about things I can't control
9/21/17, 03:17 - Ayotakshee: Like what
9/21/17, 03:17 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Like the Pune-Ghaziabad bit
9/21/17, 03:18 - Ayotakshee: Shouldn't worry you

9/21/17, 03:21 - Ayotakshee: But we're trying our best to compensate
9/21/17, 03:21 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Don't change too much without telling me, okhay :p

9/26/17, 00:53 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: In a list
9/26/17, 00:54 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: And scroll through that list
9/26/17, 00:54 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I added no UI

9/26/17, 00:55 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I could swipe the employees away to delete them which was cool
9/26/17, 00:55 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: But still copy paste

9/26/17, 00:55 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: So I chilled around till 2
9/26/17, 00:56 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: The assessment guy came up to look at my app
9/26/17, 00:56 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: He liked the swipe thingy
9/26/17, 00:56 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: But then asked me
9/26/17, 00:56 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: "Did you not understand the concept or were you just lazy"
9/26/17, 00:56 - Ayotakshee: Oh baby

9/27/17, 00:45 - Ayotakshee: As a kid, growing up, teens, college, last year
9/27/17, 00:46 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Haha wow let me think
9/27/17, 00:46 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Not that great tbh , we don't burst crackers , like thoda sa phuljadi and chackra and stuff
9/27/17, 00:46 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I spent one Diwali with my friends one time jisme we went crazy with rockets
9/27/17, 00:47 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: But generally wear a kurta
9/27/17, 00:47 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Do a puja ( my mom )
9/27/17, 00:47 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: And sit in the house after some phuljadi magic
9/27/17, 00:47 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Look into our phonezz
9/27/17, 00:47 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: We decorate the house with diyas before Diwali starts though
9/27/17, 00:47 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: What about youuu
9/27/17, 00:48 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Not very happening diwalis I'm afraid :P
9/27/17, 00:48 - Ayotakshee: Haha babyyy
9/27/17, 00:49 - Ayotakshee: As a kid in hudco (my earlier colony), we used to burst so many crackers (this is when I was a kid class 6th or something)
9/27/17, 00:50 - Ayotakshee: Gradually I just became an observer
9/27/17, 00:50 - Ayotakshee: And my parents used to get phuljhadi and basic anaae and chakra
9/27/17, 00:50 - Ayotakshee: *anaar
9/27/17, 00:51 - Ayotakshee: Then gradually I asked them to stop getting crackers altogether
9/27/17, 00:51 - Ayotakshee: And every diwali I'd spend with the 3 closest friends I had at hudco (arpita, Yamini, Vipasa)
9/27/17, 00:52 - Ayotakshee: Neither of us liked the crackers
9/27/17, 00:52 - Ayotakshee: So we'd meet at one of our houses and make food (pastas usually)
9/27/17, 00:52 - Ayotakshee: And eat and watch a movie or gossip
9/27/17, 00:52 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Hahahahahahahahaha :***
9/27/17, 00:52 - Ayotakshee: In the colony we were a large group
9/27/17, 00:53 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Gossip comes so naturally :')))
9/27/17, 00:53 - Ayotakshee: Like 20-25 kidz
9/27/17, 00:53 - Ayotakshee: Hehehehe

9/27/17, 01:00 - Ayotakshee: And usually diwali time, there's been some family over (at hudco) like either my daadi, or mausi, or tiara
9/27/17, 01:00 - Ayotakshee: So there have always been people to entertain
9/27/17, 01:00 - Ayotakshee: But last year toh sober AF diwali tha

10/3/17, 12:05 - Ayotakshee: Why do people hate America so so much

10/3/17, 12:06 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: That guy was white and not a terrorist
10/3/17, 12:07 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: 59 people is a *lot*
10/3/17, 12:07 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Un log ka gun policy is pretty fucked up

10/3/17, 13:27 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Yes bubb
10/3/17, 13:27 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Sorry just had lunch
10/3/17, 13:27 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Karta hunn
10/3/17, 13:31 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Yeah I did , he said Trump would support jobs in America and bring back the industries. He said that all the racist stuff was a stunt and it didn't really matter . I lost all respect for him. And he doesn't identify as an immigrant anymore , he thinks of himself as an American
10/3/17, 13:32 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Got a stick up his ass tbh
10/3/17, 13:32 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: He's in Texas , so that should give you an idea of him :P
10/3/17, 13:35 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: <Media omitted>
10/3/17, 14:22 - Ayotakshee: Aaaaaaaah

10/3/17, 15:12 - Ayotakshee: So I'd rather stay quiet 😔
10/3/17, 15:17 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Awww baby
10/3/17, 15:17 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: You can say it in front of me
10/3/17, 15:18 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I toh dislike him
10/3/17, 15:18 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: :******
10/3/17, 15:19 - Ayotakshee: Baby babyy
10/3/17, 15:19 - Ayotakshee: Hahaha
10/3/17, 15:19 - Ayotakshee: I love you aghhhhh
10/3/17, 15:21 - Ayotakshee: Kuchh nahi bolna tha, bas wahi that indians that have stayed abroad long enough or with a citizenship do feel like they're now Americans but what they don't realise is that even though they may be so on paper, they will always be outsiders in the natives' eyes
10/3/17, 15:22 - Ayotakshee: And iske bawajood brainwash hoke baithe rahenge sab
10/3/17, 15:22 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Agree with everything you just said
10/3/17, 15:22 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Chu ban jaate hai bahar jaake koi log
10/3/17, 15:22 - Ayotakshee: And Texas toh waise bhi Republican area
10/3/17, 15:23 - Ayotakshee: So I'm not half surprised he voted for trump
10/3/17, 15:23 - Ayotakshee: People say only (majorly) white males over 50 voted for him
10/3/17, 15:24 - Ayotakshee: But that's soo not true. Aadhe humaare migrants hi hai
10/3/17, 15:24 - Ayotakshee: Stupid wale
10/3/17, 15:24 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I was shocked , I didn't know about this ki they become totally Americanized. Yeah and you know company matters , I think in Texas he's around all these red necks .You should see his 9 year old daughter defend Trump. It's horrible
10/3/17, 15:25 - Ayotakshee: Ugh I'm so sorry :3
10/3/17, 15:25 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: When I told her about Trump's various groping incidents , she said those women are just looking for their 5 minutes of fame. A 9 year old kid said this ugh
10/3/17, 15:25 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Hahah it's a good lesson , really opens the eyes
10/3/17, 15:25 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: We'll never be like them
10/3/17, 15:26 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Not identify with one country so strongly
10/3/17, 15:27 - Ayotakshee: +100000000
10/3/17, 15:27 - Ayotakshee: Is this the sister of the brother that abuses a lot for a kid?
10/3/17, 15:33 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Yuss

10/9/17, 15:30 - Ayotakshee: And I realised technology is fkn brilliant
10/9/17, 15:33 - Ayotakshee: We talked about this too. How people tend to want to talk to a stranger in majority of cases
10/9/17, 15:34 - Ayotakshee: And how the people closest to the sufferer don't know what they're going through
10/9/17, 15:35 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: So your idea is a therapist virtual agent /digital human ?
10/9/17, 15:36 - Ayotakshee: Not a therapist
10/9/17, 15:36 - Ayotakshee: A friend
10/9/17, 15:36 - Ayotakshee: But someone who will have so much more knpwliedge
10/9/17, 15:36 - Ayotakshee: *knowledge
10/9/17, 15:37 - Ayotakshee: And will be able to support, motivate and reassure you like friend but guide you like a therapist

10/9/17, 15:44 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: That's what deep mind wants to do ,
10/9/17, 15:45 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: "understand intelligence , then apply it to solves the world's problems"
10/9/17, 15:45 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: And they're nowhere near
10/9/17, 16:04 - Ayotakshee: Yas
10/9/17, 16:04 - Ayotakshee: We figured
10/9/17, 16:05 - Ayotakshee: But we essentially had to put this concept into use
10/9/17, 16:05 - Ayotakshee: So they're all idealistic products 30 years from now

10/29/17, 18:52 - Ayotakshee: I'll be okay baby
10/29/17, 18:52 - Ayotakshee: I just don't want you to think about it all the time
10/29/17, 19:01 - Ayotakshee: Match going to start now bubby

10/29/17, 19:02 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Best of luccccck
10/29/17, 19:03 - Ayotakshee: Eh
10/29/17, 20:52 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: How was the match baby ?
10/29/17, 20:59 - Ayotakshee: We lost hehe
10/29/17, 20:59 - Ayotakshee: It was sad, kya strategize ki thi mere team ke bando ne
10/29/17, 20:59 - Ayotakshee: Saara fail
10/29/17, 20:59 - Ayotakshee: (It was kinda funny)
10/29/17, 21:00 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Puchi for u :*
10/29/17, 21:00 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: You win some , you lose some bubba
10/29/17, 21:00 - Ayotakshee: Imma tell you the strategy now
10/29/17, 21:00 - Ayotakshee: Hear me rant
10/29/17, 21:00 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Hahah okay
10/29/17, 21:01 - Ayotakshee: So they said chalo iss baar strategy har baar se change karte hai
10/29/17, 21:02 - Ayotakshee: And then made this boy Amish (he's a nice boy. Plays really well. But not under pressure) play the first singles. Shubhendu (the main boy. He's brilliant) asked him a 1000 times only if you guarantee a win. Because accordingly Amish and Shubhendu will play doubles and I will play mixed doubles with a different boy (Avijit) and not Shubhendu like we usually do
10/29/17, 21:03 - Ayotakshee: And he said yes yes he'll definitely win
10/29/17, 21:03 - Ayotakshee: Because aaj ke match mein humko tha ki I won't win the singles cuz anjali is really good
10/29/17, 21:04 - Ayotakshee: Shubhendu apna singles toh 100% jeetta. Had Amish and Shubhendu played doubles, woh bhi 95% jeet jate
10/29/17, 21:04 - Ayotakshee: Avijit and me were a 100% losing game.
10/29/17, 21:04 - Ayotakshee: And assumption that I will lose
10/29/17, 21:04 - Ayotakshee: So Amish *had* to guarantee a win
10/29/17, 21:04 - Ayotakshee: Which he said he would, but....he didn't win
10/29/17, 21:05 - Ayotakshee: So agla match aaya mera
10/29/17, 21:05 - Ayotakshee: First set I lost
10/29/17, 21:05 - Ayotakshee: (I always do lol. I always lose the first set. Warm up you see :p jkjk. I suck)
10/29/17, 21:05 - Ayotakshee: I thought uh oh
10/29/17, 21:05 - Ayotakshee: Second set again I lost
10/29/17, 21:05 - Ayotakshee: I thought uhh ohh
10/29/17, 21:06 - Ayotakshee: So third set I went crazy calm
10/29/17, 21:06 - Ayotakshee: And won
10/29/17, 21:06 - Ayotakshee: Then fourth set also jeet gayi pata nahi kaise
10/29/17, 21:06 - Ayotakshee: My team went crazy
10/29/17, 21:07 - Ayotakshee: Then last set pokra equal equal chal raha tha. But last mein 9-9 ke baad, woh jeet gayi
10/29/17, 21:07 - Ayotakshee: I felt so ugh
10/29/17, 21:07 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Oh bubbyyyy
10/29/17, 21:07 - Ayotakshee: Like ab toh haar gaye
10/29/17, 21:07 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Daaaaamn
10/29/17, 21:07 - Ayotakshee: Because next was Avijit and me. And that was a guaranteed loss
10/29/17, 21:07 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: You were soooo good
10/29/17, 21:08 - Ayotakshee: And Shubhendu didn't even get to play
10/29/17, 21:08 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Okay
10/29/17, 21:08 - Ayotakshee: And I felt so bad
10/29/17, 21:08 - Ayotakshee: Because he's the best player we have
10/29/17, 21:08 - Ayotakshee: Meh
10/29/17, 21:08 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Oh , damn Shubhenduu
10/29/17, 21:08 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: He must be a bit sad
10/29/17, 21:09 - Ayotakshee: Yeah
10/29/17, 21:09 - Ayotakshee: And mad too
10/29/17, 21:09 - Ayotakshee: But he's calm AF too
10/29/17, 21:09 - Ayotakshee: So he doesn't show it

10/29/17, 21:10 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Ah it sucks , but at least all of you gave your best shot
10/29/17, 21:10 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Move on now
10/29/17, 21:10 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Amish ain't to blame
10/29/17, 21:10 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: It's not that he was trying to lose
10/29/17, 21:10 - Ayotakshee: I know Amish and I joked about this for a long time
10/29/17, 21:10 - Ayotakshee: He's really nice
10/29/17, 21:11 - Ayotakshee: And we made jokes about how if be jumps from his fourth floor, sahi hai uske liye but I'm on first floor so if I jump I'll only get injured
10/29/17, 21:11 - Ayotakshee: *if he jumps
10/29/17, 21:12 - Ayotakshee: (We're juz kiddin okk)

10/30/17, 19:02 - Ayotakshee: Hahaha
10/30/17, 19:02 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: We're going to do a lucky toss
10/30/17, 19:02 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: So he was talking about probability
10/30/17, 19:02 - Ayotakshee: Oh fackkk
10/30/17, 19:02 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Mujhe kuch samaj nahi aaya
10/30/17, 19:02 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I'm so dumbbbbb
10/30/17, 19:02 - Ayotakshee: Hahaha no wait I'll come up with a better wayy
10/30/17, 19:02 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Yes , then I'll say it's my idea
10/30/17, 19:03 - Ayotakshee: Hahahaha
10/30/17, 19:04 - Ayotakshee: Okayy so about the probability thing tho
10/30/17, 19:05 - Ayotakshee: It'll be okay if everyone picks up together
10/30/17, 19:05 - Ayotakshee: But ek ek karke check karogey toh probability change hota rahega right?
10/30/17, 19:05 - Ayotakshee: :p
10/30/17, 19:05 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Haaan
10/30/17, 19:05 - Ayotakshee: Is that what vaibhav meant?
10/30/17, 19:05 - Ayotakshee: Wao
10/30/17, 19:05 - Ayotakshee: Wut problems
10/30/17, 19:05 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I'm saying ki agar same room aaya toh
10/30/17, 19:05 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Phir hum ek aur baar karenge
10/30/17, 19:06 - Ayotakshee: Same room kaise aayega....
10/30/17, 19:06 - Ayotakshee: OHH ARE THEY DIVIDING IT RIGHT NOW?
10/30/17, 19:07 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Like there are 3 rooms and then we have 3 ,  3 headed dice to pick what rooms we get. So we toss the dices at the same time
10/30/17, 19:07 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: And if say two of us get the same room
10/30/17, 19:07 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: We do it again
10/30/17, 19:07 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Like the two of us who got the same room
10/30/17, 19:08 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: The other person gets what he gets
10/30/17, 19:08 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: No that's for tomorrow or something
10/30/17, 19:10 - Ayotakshee: Waooo
10/30/17, 19:10 - Ayotakshee: That's sooo complicated
10/30/17, 19:12 - Ayotakshee: You take 3 chits. Write 1 2 and 3 on them
10/30/17, 19:12 - Ayotakshee: Shuffle
10/30/17, 19:12 - Ayotakshee: Separate out the chits
10/30/17, 19:12 - Ayotakshee: Do not pick or open them
10/30/17, 19:14 - Ayotakshee: Place a glass over each chit. So now you can see three glasses with three chits under them
10/30/17, 19:14 - Ayotakshee: And then you do that fancy shifting of glasses thingg
10/30/17, 19:14 - Ayotakshee: And then each of you have to choose one glass
10/30/17, 19:14 - Ayotakshee: All at the same time
10/30/17, 19:14 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Lol , WE'RE NOT MAGICIANS OKAY AYO
10/30/17, 19:15 - Ayotakshee: And all of you check at the same timee
10/30/17, 19:15 - Ayotakshee: Hahahaha pls
10/30/17, 19:15 - Ayotakshee: I love the fancy glass shifting thing
10/30/17, 19:15 - Ayotakshee: It looks so cool
10/30/17, 19:16 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: This is like the same thing but I said, but with more fancy glass thing
10/30/17, 19:16 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Useless
10/30/17, 19:16 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Vaibhav said ki 6 permutations hongi of all the combinations
10/30/17, 19:17 - Ayotakshee: No but there's no redundancy
10/30/17, 19:17 - Ayotakshee: No repetition of numbers
10/30/17, 19:17 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: So make 6 chits and make a computer program to select a random number of 1-6
10/30/17, 19:17 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Fancy glass thing is hard to do
10/30/17, 19:18 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: What if we choose the same glass
10/30/17, 20:48 - Ayotakshee: Hi boo
10/30/17, 20:48 - Ayotakshee: Sorry I wasn't available on textt
10/30/17, 20:49 - Ayotakshee: You guys are super schmancy
10/30/17, 20:49 - Ayotakshee: (Fancy schmancy)
10/30/17, 20:51 - Ayotakshee: Why 1-6 though?
10/30/17, 20:51 - Ayotakshee: Aren't you dividing 3 rooms?
10/30/17, 20:51 - Ayotakshee: I'm a little dum, baby
10/30/17, 21:01 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I didn't get it at first too, bub
10/30/17, 21:01 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: He said that
10/30/17, 21:01 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: There are 3 rooms so
10/30/17, 21:02 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: If the permutation is like Karan Vaibhav Sandeep = 213
10/30/17, 21:02 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Where I get the second room
10/30/17, 21:02 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: And Vaibhav the first and Sandeep the third
10/30/17, 21:02 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: There can only be 6 combinations
10/30/17, 21:02 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: 123
10/30/17, 21:02 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: 132
10/30/17, 21:02 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: 213
10/30/17, 21:02 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: 231
10/30/17, 21:02 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: 312
10/30/17, 21:02 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: 321
10/30/17, 21:02 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Hence six
10/30/17, 21:03 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Like that
10/30/17, 21:03 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: So just roll the dice for these six combinations
10/30/17, 21:03 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Yeah Vaibhav is irritating that way
10/30/17, 21:04 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: It's okaaay
10/30/17, 21:04 - Ayotakshee: Yep this makes sense nao
10/30/17, 21:04 - Ayotakshee: Noh
10/30/17, 21:04 - Ayotakshee: It's actually cool
10/30/17, 21:04 - Ayotakshee: This maketh sense
10/30/17, 21:04 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I know
10/30/17, 21:04 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: That's irritating
10/30/17, 21:04 - Ayotakshee: Haha damn

10/30/17, 21:06 - Ayotakshee: Or all that analytical stuff
10/30/17, 21:07 - Ayotakshee: Just that he sounds like he likes to explain stuff
10/30/17, 21:07 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Hahah no he doesn't , he just says it . And expects you to understand.
10/30/17, 21:08 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I had to tell him to explain it

11/3/17, 22:28 - Ayotakshee: Okay bub, me too. Text me before you go to sleep
11/3/17, 22:28 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Okay my love
11/3/17, 22:31 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Do you think , telling children about Santa Claus and then after they get a little older telling them that he doesn't exist , leads to them to being less credulous and losing their innocence ?
11/3/17, 22:32 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Why do we do it ?
11/3/17, 22:33 - Ayotakshee: I don't think they lose their innocence. But as kids I think parents like to keep our minds alive and let our imaginations run wild
11/3/17, 22:34 - Ayotakshee: Making kids believe in reality from the get go probably feels harsh. Because as a parent you want your kid to live in a perfect world for as long as he/she can
11/3/17, 22:35 - Ayotakshee: My parents never told me Santa or the tooth fairy doesn't exist. I guess I just gradually figured out on my own
11/3/17, 22:35 - Ayotakshee: Made me feel like a detective
11/3/17, 22:35 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Hmm yeah  ,I was thinking from the time when they do get to know , and suddenly their eyes widen in shock and then sadness.
11/3/17, 22:35 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Hahahahaa
11/3/17, 22:35 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Yeah maybe children grow out of it naturally
11/3/17, 22:36 - Ayotakshee: Yes baby, I think that's better than telling them and see the light drain out of their eyea
11/3/17, 22:36 - Ayotakshee: *eyes
11/3/17, 22:36 - Ayotakshee: Why do you ask though bub
11/3/17, 22:36 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Slow burn vs the bandage rip
11/3/17, 22:36 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Nothing I is read a sample sentence about the word credulous
11/3/17, 22:36 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: *just
11/3/17, 22:37 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: It had this about 8 year olds
11/3/17, 22:37 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Being less credulous than 4 year olds
11/3/17, 22:37 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Credulous - trusting , innocent , naive
11/3/17, 22:38 - Ayotakshee: Yes baby
11/3/17, 22:37 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I'll get back to it

11/12/17, 00:33 - Ayotakshee: Oh bubuu
11/12/17, 00:33 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Then I was about to start a movie and was home alone
11/12/17, 00:33 - Ayotakshee: Sin day
11/12/17, 00:34 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: The carpenter had come to fix my lock
11/12/17, 00:34 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: So that was going on in the background
11/12/17, 00:34 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I looked up some movies and TV shows and realised I wasn't in the mood for anything / couldn't find anything good
11/12/17, 00:34 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: So I switched on a deep learning lecture on the background , hardly listened to it
11/12/17, 00:35 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: And stared vacantly on the couch
11/12/17, 00:35 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Vaibhav had gone at this time to the gym or something
11/12/17, 00:35 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I just lazed on the couch till 7
11/12/17, 00:35 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: That's when the internet guy came
11/12/17, 00:35 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: After so long
11/12/17, 00:35 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Our internet hadn't been working for 5 days

11/12/17, 00:36 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Guy left at 8 p.m
11/12/17, 00:36 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: We had decided ki aaj ka dinner we are making ourselves
11/12/17, 00:36 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: No way we're ordering
11/12/17, 00:37 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: So got the scooti out
11/12/17, 00:37 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: And went grocery shopping
11/12/17, 00:37 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: We brought museli , chicken , eggs. Bread , Cinnamon , cloves , spinach , onions, apples , oranges , milk , beans
11/12/17, 00:38 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: We had to hunt for the chicken and the eggs because the grocery shops had closed down
11/12/17, 00:38 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: So that took a while
11/12/17, 00:38 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Came back by 10:00
11/12/17, 00:38 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Then I had to clean all the utensils and wash all the vegetables
11/12/17, 00:39 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Because I was OCD about the stuff having dirt or whatever
11/12/17, 00:39 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: My back hurt after a while of doin that , but managed to get it done
11/12/17, 00:39 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Then as Vaibhav doesn't know shit about cooking
11/12/17, 00:39 - Ayotakshee: Oh baby
11/12/17, 00:40 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I put the chicken and spinach beans Cinnamon cloves and black pepper into a pressure cooker and basically followed my mom's instructions
11/12/17, 00:40 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I called her 4 times today asking her about stuff
11/12/17, 00:40 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: That's like 4 weeks worth of conversation in one day

11/12/17, 16:28 - Ayotakshee: Noh
11/12/17, 16:28 - Ayotakshee: But this reminds me of a funny incident
11/12/17, 16:28 - Ayotakshee: There was this one time when I had my internals on some fest ka date
11/12/17, 16:28 - Ayotakshee: And I knew I'd get late so I'd asked the dance team to ask for one of the latest slots for our turn
11/12/17, 16:28 - Ayotakshee: And to practice substituting me as well (just in case)
11/12/17, 16:28 - Ayotakshee: And what happened was that I was in the metro and our turn was approaching
11/12/17, 16:28 - Ayotakshee: And the team kept stalling as much as they could
11/12/17, 16:28 - Ayotakshee: I was talking to the coordinators from my side
11/12/17, 16:28 - Ayotakshee: And then I realised I won't make it
11/12/17, 16:28 - Ayotakshee: So I wished my team luck and asked the coordinator to tell me as soon as my team steps  on stage
11/12/17, 16:28 - Ayotakshee: I reached the final metro station. Just had to take the auto. And he called saying your team is stepping onstage
11/12/17, 16:28 - Ayotakshee: I thought oh, little silver lining
11/12/17, 16:28 - Ayotakshee: But call aa gaya
11/12/17, 16:28 - Ayotakshee: So I put on the mix (the piece on which we dance)
11/12/17, 16:28 - Ayotakshee: And was counting time. Because they were simultaneously onstage and I was in the auto
11/12/17, 16:28 - Ayotakshee: 6 minutes, I reached the college, they were done with the sequence and my dance mix got over
11/12/17, 16:28 - Ayotakshee: It was kinda awesome
11/12/17, 16:47 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Oh baby
11/12/17, 16:48 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Fiddling with time

11/19/17, 20:35 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: And not ask anything concrete
11/19/17, 20:35 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: So Im being vague now
11/19/17, 20:35 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Not very positive, no
11/19/17, 20:36 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: They're mostly in their room so it's like living alone anyway
11/19/17, 20:36 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: It's cool
11/19/17, 20:36 - Ayotakshee: Oh bub
11/19/17, 20:36 - Ayotakshee: Don't you guys all hang out together?

11/20/17, 00:50 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: What they were saying is that the models we have right now
11/20/17, 00:50 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Don't have any common sense
11/20/17, 00:50 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: It takes a million examples for the machine to learn
11/20/17, 00:50 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: But humans learn it in a few examples
11/20/17, 00:51 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: And stuff like driving off a cliff
11/20/17, 00:51 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: We don't even try
11/20/17, 00:51 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: So that's common sense
11/20/17, 00:51 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Which machines don't have
11/20/17, 00:51 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: The ability to fill in the blanks
11/20/17, 00:51 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: At least that's an interpretation of how we think
11/20/17, 00:52 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Yes bubby. Presentation all done. I'm just going to wing it
11/20/17, 00:52 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: It's in the laptop that's at office anyway

11/20/17, 01:00 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: What are you trying to sayyy
11/20/17, 01:00 - Ayotakshee: Our professor was telling us a random story.
We're teaching the machine to guess what animal. 
Human says ok.
Machine: is it a pig?
Human: no, dog
Machine: how do I know you thought of a dog?
Human: you ask 'does it bark?'
Machine: Ok try again.
Human: okay
Machine: does it bark?
Human: no
Machine: it is a pig
Human: no I thought of a cow
Machine: how do I know it is a cow
Human: you ask if it moos
Machine: ok try again
Human: k
Machine: does it bark?
Human: no
Machine: does it moo?
Human: no
Machine: it is a pig

11/20/17, 01:01 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Also that's very interesting
11/20/17, 01:02 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Machines don't really ask questions
11/20/17, 01:02 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Damn who knows what's going to be possible

11/21/17, 21:51 - Ayotakshee: i pretty much spent the entire day trying to get signal lol
11/21/17, 21:51 - Ayotakshee: not for the startup bit
11/21/17, 21:52 - Ayotakshee: but because of the foreign nation stalls
11/21/17, 21:52 - Ayotakshee: we were just walking
11/21/17, 21:52 - Ayotakshee: and mamma was buying random stuff
11/21/17, 21:52 - Ayotakshee: i got so bored
11/21/17, 21:52 - Ayotakshee: lulz
11/21/17, 21:52 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Hahahah
11/21/17, 21:53 - Ayotakshee: we bought stuff we don't even need i think
11/21/17, 21:53 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Hahahahahaha , I get so bored after the first 1-2 hours at those things
11/21/17, 21:53 - Ayotakshee: like kambals
11/21/17, 21:53 - Ayotakshee: (we got 3 blankets, karan. Three)
11/21/17, 21:53 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Makes sense
11/21/17, 21:53 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: 3 for you three
11/21/17, 21:53 - Ayotakshee: From a Netherlands wala stall....
11/21/17, 21:53 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Hahahaaaaa

11/21/17, 21:54 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Those must've been expensiiiiiive
11/21/17, 21:54 - Ayotakshee: i have no idea how much blankets cost...
11/21/17, 21:54 - Ayotakshee: but a couple of ladies asked us how much we got ours for (they had a suitcase thing with the same blanket)
11/21/17, 21:55 - Ayotakshee: and when mamma told them, their eyes widened and we could see the light disappearing fromtheir eyes
11/21/17, 21:55 - Ayotakshee: (they probably thought they got a good deal, but they were sooo looted)
11/21/17, 21:55 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Hahahaahaha , so you guys had the better deal ?
11/21/17, 21:55 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: That makes no sense
11/21/17, 21:55 - Ayotakshee: i think they were selling 2800 ke 2 single blankets, mamma got them for 1400
11/21/17, 21:55 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: You suck at bargaining
11/21/17, 21:56 - Ayotakshee: (apparently she bought them last year too)
11/21/17, 21:56 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: HAHAHA
11/21/17, 21:56 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Ok, she might have a problem
11/21/17, 21:56 - Ayotakshee: so the fact that she got them for 1400 makes sense...
11/21/17, 21:56 - Ayotakshee: but we just bought a couple last year......
11/21/17, 21:56 - Ayotakshee: so.....ya
11/21/17, 21:56 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Hahaha

11/28/17, 00:06 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Watched modern family ka ek episode while eating
11/28/17, 00:07 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: And then as Vaibhav and I wanted to do a project together
11/28/17, 00:07 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: We started working on that noww

11/28/17, 00:08 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Setting up the project
11/28/17, 00:08 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: And he told me something that is slightly worrying about him and Sonali kinda
11/28/17, 00:08 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Well he doesn't like it as much I felt
11/28/17, 00:08 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Ki apparently

11/28/17, 00:10 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: She is not making any effort to tell her parents at all

11/28/17, 00:10 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: College ke bad when you start working Bata degi
11/28/17, 00:10 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: But she isn't
11/28/17, 00:10 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: And he feels kinda sad
11/28/17, 00:10 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Matlab he tried to shrug it off and say it's cool and all

11/28/17, 00:18 - Ayotakshee: And especially if they're asking her
11/28/17, 00:18 - Ayotakshee: Then if she continues to lie and say no, it's going to ruin her relationship with them later (when she does tell them about vaibhav)
11/28/17, 00:19 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Yeah,  that's what Vaibhav says too
11/28/17, 00:19 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Sonali is very stubborn
11/28/17, 00:19 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Agar she says no
11/28/17, 00:19 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Then she won't agree
11/28/17, 00:20 - Ayotakshee: Oh damn
11/28/17, 00:20 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Mera Tha
11/28/17, 00:21 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Ki abhi bhi nahi keh rahi
11/28/17, 00:21 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: So is she still hesitant
11/28/17, 00:21 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Which is so crazy
11/28/17, 00:21 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Because she calls Vaibhav everyday
11/28/17, 00:21 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: And they talk aache tarah
11/28/17, 00:21 - Ayotakshee: Yeah I didn't want to say this
11/28/17, 00:21 - Ayotakshee: But I thought this toi
11/28/17, 00:21 - Ayotakshee: *too
11/28/17, 00:22 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Yeah I asked him
11/28/17, 00:22 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: And he said
11/28/17, 00:22 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Yeh toh nahi hai
11/28/17, 00:22 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: At least he said that to me
11/28/17, 00:23 - Ayotakshee: But then why not is what I don't understand
11/28/17, 00:23 - Ayotakshee: Vaibhav is good with all this reasoning stuff. Has he been able to get out a valid reason from sonali?
11/28/17, 00:24 - Ayotakshee: This makes me a little sad, baby
11/28/17, 00:28 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: She says that her family is very orthodox
11/28/17, 00:28 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: And they will kick her out
11/28/17, 00:28 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: But Vaibhav feels that itna koi nahi karta
11/28/17, 00:29 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I don't like Sonali so much at this moment lol
11/28/17, 00:29 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: And then he asked me
11/28/17, 00:29 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Ki do Ayo's parents know
11/28/17, 00:29 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: And I said ki she has given them hints
11/28/17, 00:29 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: And I think they pretty much knoww
11/28/17, 00:30 - Ayotakshee: I have sent them photos of us too
11/28/17, 00:30 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: You didd
11/28/17, 00:30 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: When ,where ki ?
11/28/17, 00:30 - Ayotakshee: Snapchat et al
11/28/17, 00:30 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Oh so there you go
11/28/17, 00:30 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Like little things like that , you don't have to do them , matlab I think you want them to know dheere dheere
11/28/17, 00:31 - Ayotakshee: And she knows you came to meet me on my birthday
11/28/17, 00:31 - Ayotakshee: And got me brownies and all haha
11/28/17, 00:31 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: She apparently sees no need for that
11/28/17, 00:31 - Ayotakshee: Mamma had said "interesting"
11/28/17, 00:31 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Which is weird after like 4-5 years
11/28/17, 00:31 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Hahahaha
11/28/17, 00:31 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Yeaaas
11/28/17, 00:31 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: And that was toh like 2 months mein
11/28/17, 00:31 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: 2 months into the relationship
11/28/17, 00:32 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: You've been like very open
11/28/17, 00:32 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Which Isl know is not your style
11/28/17, 00:32 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: *I
11/28/17, 00:32 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: You didn't tell them anything pehle haina about the other guys
11/28/17, 00:33 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: So the fact you're doing itna bhi
11/28/17, 00:33 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I feel really good when you say stuff like that
11/28/17, 00:35 - Ayotakshee: no baby, i didn't tell them about any one else
11/28/17, 00:35 - Ayotakshee: i tried putting myself in sonali's shoes too yknow
11/28/17, 00:36 - Ayotakshee: but no matter how orthodox, moms ko toh pata chal jata hi hai
11/28/17, 00:36 - Ayotakshee: and if she wants to have any sort of future with him, she's got to start easing them into this
11/28/17, 00:36 - Ayotakshee: otherwise it's just not going to happen
11/28/17, 00:37 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: And Vaibhav told his parents on day 2 or something
11/28/17, 00:37 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: You're right
11/28/17, 00:40 - Ayotakshee: Oh woah
11/28/17, 00:41 - Ayotakshee: Khair that varies I guess. I see that he was super into her and just knew, but we can't expect the same from her tho
11/28/17, 00:45 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Hmmm

12/10/17, 00:13 - Ayotakshee: When you were not around for a few days because of the project and then you said you'd call and I knew you wouldn't have the time to, so I felt like that was unnecessary

12/10/17, 22:21 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Medical field main hai
12/10/17, 22:21 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Nowadays pathogilists spend a lot of time on looking at images of patients diseases
12/10/17, 22:21 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: To figure out what disease they have
12/10/17, 22:21 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: It's a time consuming process
12/10/17, 22:22 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: And takes like 2-3 minute to find cancer cells in a breast histology image as an example
12/10/17, 22:22 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: You could reduce that by a lot if you can automate it
12/10/17, 22:22 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: And ask the computer to tell you what disease a photo has
12/10/17, 22:23 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Hospitals need computers more
12/10/17, 22:23 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: A lot of processes are very manual
12/10/17, 22:23 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: So yeag
12/10/17, 22:23 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Thats the ideology
12/10/17, 22:23 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: But we haven't really figured out the idea as yet

12/27/17, 23:07 - Ayotakshee: Viraj has also won 3/5
12/27/17, 23:08 - Ayotakshee: So if they win theirs then all 3 of us P, A and V will be at 4/5
12/27/17, 23:08 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: And how will you guys decide that ?
12/27/17, 23:08 - Ayotakshee: And Viraj wala team will definitely win

12/27/17, 23:10 - Ayotakshee: We'll have to win by a large point margin. And we have to hope that viraj ka team doesn't win against keshav with that much

1/2/18, 23:06 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: U sukah
1/2/18, 23:07 - Ayotakshee: Ya ya voteva
1/2/18, 23:45 - Ayotakshee: I was a little annoyed yesterday that shaam se hum baat nahi kar paye. But then you were hanging out with sonali and vaibhav, so I understood. And after that I wasn't in the mood to talk. Anyway, I realised that I do that sometimes too. When I'm hanging out with Dhruv and viraj. That maybe I lose track of time, so I shouldn't mind. Anyway, I slept it off and woke up early today. 8:30. Even though I had class at 12. I also was supposed to have a quiz at 11:45. Which is why I'd actually come back a day earlier. But the quiz got postponed, so my coming to campus early was kinda a waste. Anyway, I had class till 3:30 and then a one hour meeting with a teacher which only 6 SAWC members attended lol. The meeting got me dying inside but the teacher gave us all munch at the end because new year so it was cool (he brought 2 whole boxes. And just 6 of us..) Anyway, after that I had another class from 6-7 after which I came to my room and I haven't left since. Not even for dinner. It's too cold outside and I'm coughing too much. That's pretty much been my day. I'm tucked in my razai now and I'm going to make myself hot water to drink
1/3/18, 11:11 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Good morning ,my sweet ❤
1/3/18, 11:11 - Ayotakshee: Good morning bub, did you just wake up?
1/3/18, 11:12 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: No, I woke up at 9:20
1/3/18, 11:12 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Had breakfast
1/3/18, 11:12 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: At home , just lying on my bed
1/3/18, 11:12 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: You ?
1/3/18, 11:20 - Ayotakshee: I had the worst night
1/3/18, 11:25 - Ayotakshee: Around 4:30 there was a sharp shooting pain through my left ear and my head was just killing me. I couldn't understand what to do to stop it. I wanted to die. My nose was also blocked so I put otrivin ke drops (usse naak khul jata hai) and my brain was running at 200 km/hr and I couldn't get it to slowdown and peace out. I felt suffocated and everything was annoying me, even the hole in my sock so I put on fresh socks, put cotton in my ears, wore my woollen cap, had some hot water and came back to bed. Bohot mushkil se got myself to sleep through the horrid pain again
1/3/18, 11:34 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Uh Bub, I really think you need to go to the hospital
1/3/18, 11:34 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I think you might have viral fever

1/3/18, 11:34 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: *ke
1/3/18, 11:35 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Baby baby baby
1/3/18, 11:35 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Yeah brains seem like they're thinking so much and processing so much when you're ill

1/5/18, 01:34 - Ayotakshee: I wouldn't wish it on anyone

1/5/18, 01:39 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Second
1/5/18, 01:40 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Study harder in 11 and 12 and earn my place at NSIT instead of the defense quota business
1/5/18, 01:40 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: (this not really waise )
1/5/18, 01:40 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: It really taught me a lot about hard work
1/5/18, 01:40 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: And it's value
1/5/18, 01:40 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: It was kind of the perfect lesson
1/5/18, 01:41 - Ayotakshee: So this is actually something I find odd in the world. Is it always necessary to learn something from tough situations/bad experiences?
1/5/18, 01:42 - Ayotakshee: Because that's what you said for the accident thing too
1/5/18, 01:42 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: In my experience , it has been bub
1/5/18, 01:43 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I mean, that first year was so demoralising and I really got to know that I'm actually next to nothing. And I gotta work so much more harder than I was used to
1/5/18, 01:43 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Not necessary though I guess
1/5/18, 01:44 - Ayotakshee: Makes sense
1/5/18, 01:44 - Ayotakshee: This is something I need to think about
1/5/18, 01:45 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I was reminded of it every time I was in class , or these smart kids were discussing some tough problem
1/5/18, 01:45 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: And in general also
1/5/18, 01:45 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Talking , conversing with them
1/5/18, 01:46 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Some people couldn't cope, Jo Sc, St log the
1/5/18, 01:46 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: They stopped trying after a while
1/5/18, 01:46 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: And failed or just we're barely surviving college
1/5/18, 01:46 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: *were
1/5/18, 01:47 - Ayotakshee: Its like lose something to really understand the importance of something

1/7/18, 03:27 - Ayotakshee: I also realised a lot of things btw
1/7/18, 03:27 - Ayotakshee: Forgot to tell you
1/7/18, 03:27 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: What ?
1/7/18, 03:28 - Ayotakshee: Kunjika was telling me about how Yash (her boyfriend) is sometimes oblivious of things like safety etc
1/7/18, 03:28 - Ayotakshee: Like he left her alone in the middle of the road in the night while talking on the phone and walked away (it was a work call and he phased off)
1/7/18, 03:29 - Ayotakshee: And kunju was telling me how he doesn't have any sisters so things like this didn't come naturally to him
1/7/18, 03:30 - Ayotakshee: And I immediately could connect to this. Because I've seen how you're with Anna. And I see how you're always concerned about her safety and everything. And you care. And I'm so lucky that you had that and grew up like that
1/7/18, 03:30 - Ayotakshee: Because it's shaped you
1/7/18, 03:30 - Ayotakshee: And you're so aware of things
1/7/18, 03:31 - Ayotakshee: Little did things
1/7/18, 03:31 - Ayotakshee: And I'm just vvv lucky. Not all boys even with sisters are like that
1/7/18, 03:31 - Ayotakshee: I'm just really lucky.
1/7/18, 03:31 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Boobooo
1/7/18, 03:31 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Staaawp
1/7/18, 03:31 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: You're so not
1/7/18, 03:31 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Lucky
1/7/18, 03:32 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I mean, I guess having sisters helped
1/7/18, 03:32 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: But if anything is about you
1/7/18, 03:32 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I stop and think
1/7/18, 03:32 - Ayotakshee: No, but boys with sisters aren't all like thiss
1/7/18, 03:32 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: And try to think of all the different scenarios that could happen
1/7/18, 03:32 - Ayotakshee: You're aware of any and everything I might need

1/15/18, 17:40 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Grofers is a HyperLocal On demand logistics system. The core service of Grofer is to deliver grocery, fruits, vegetables and much more daily use household items to you within few hours. Grofers does not own any grocery store or have no warehouses.

The company partners with grocery stores in the city and the delivery boys pick the items from those stores to fulfill the customer’s order. You can place your order through the mobile application using your Android or iPhone or you can go to Grofer’s website through your desktop
1/15/18, 18:14 - Ayotakshee: Hyperlocal business refers to all businesses in a particular area or vicinity. The nearby grocery shop, general merchant, restaurant, market, mall and other products and service providers, hyperlocal businesses are centred around where you live.

In order to bring massive scale demand and deliver the goods in the shortest possible time, hyperlocal businesses are taking to e-commerce and in the process, are merging online and offline platforms of business. Such platforms aim to solve the problem of matching immediate demand with the nearest available supply in the most optimised manner. Swiggy - a hyperlocal food delivery service, Grofers - a hyperlocal grocery app and Urbanclap - a hyperlocal service marketplace, are some examples of such businesses.

The Indian e-commerce industry is estimated to cross USD 100 billion by 2020. The rise of internet users, payment options, proliferation of geolocation aware devices and suitable demographics have paved the way for hyperlocal businesses. Now, e-commerce giants who have already spent millions online on customer acquisition are acknowledging and looking to bear fruit from this hyperlocal business opportunity.
It acts as an additional channel for sales, allows brands to connect better with customers and with the right infrastructure investments, customer behavior can be measured leading to products being marketed more efficiently than offline efforts. A local grocery or restaurant owner for example, can extend his brand to food delivery without spending much on personnel or infrastructure.

While the hyperlocal business is being seen as the next avenue to accelerating commerce scale, executing the model however is a challenge.

Grofers, a HyperLocal On demand logistics system, delivers grocery, fruits, vegetables and many more daily use household items to the customer within a few hours. However, Grofers does not own any grocery store or have any warehouses! The company partners with grocery stores in the city. Once orders are placed, delivery boys pickup the items from those stores and delivers them to the customer to fulfil their orders. 

Amazon and Paytm too have taken to hyperlocal services. For example, Amazon and Paytm have launched Amazon Kirana and the Zip mobile app respectively, both being tested in Bengaluru. Ola has also launched Ola store, a hyperlocal grocery mobile app.
1/15/18, 18:48 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Traditional retail chains follow a sequential multi-tier structure: manufacturer, centralised warehouse, regional distribution centres and physical stores. As a result, the movement of goods is slow, more inventory is distributed in the entire chain and the operating cost of maintaining various facilities, especially the stores, is substantial. Customers interact with the retail staff in the store and their shopping experience is store-centric.

Whereas e-retail does away with multi-echelon distribution centre model and ships the item direct from the warehouse to the customer without maintaining any of the facilities and having to bear overheads. The online shopping experience is almost impersonal.

The pressure on the e-retail chains comes from the type of shoppers who order goods online. Consider typical young or middle-aged, impatient shoppers expecting delivery of items within a day or two, if not in a few hours, or else they will click and order on a rival website. Logistics, therefore, plays an even greater role in these supply chains: the burden of last-mile delivery is on the e-retailer, unlike a brick-and-mortar retailer where you would drive to the store to pick up the item. Keeping both logistics costs lower and delivery-time lesser is always a trade-off, a slippery one at best.

In conventional retail, the logistics cost are only up to the bulk movement of goods to main store. But an e-retailer has to pack the items to prevent damage during transit that are in small lots of parcels, which delivery boys often carry in bags slung over their shoulders. Moreover, free shipping tags along with most of internet sales. For the online shopper, the delivery boys are the first and only flesh- and-blood contact with the company, and their interaction with the customer—the last leg in the supply chain—may sweeten or sour the overall experience of the customer. Oddly, though, the delivery boy may be from an independent logistics company, the online retailer bears the brunt of the shopper.

Realising the importance of logistics, many online retailers, especially the big ones, have set up their own companies or are moving in this direction instead of hiring third-party logistics (3PL) services providers and courier companies. Flipkart has eKart as its logistics arm, while Amazon set up Amazon Transportation Services Private Limited in India.

Supply chain managers of the traditional retailers who have added an e-retail arm are a harried lot as items may have to be picked up from anywhere in the entire chain, often from the store itself, to fulfil a sudden online order. On top of that, a pure e-retail supply chain has hassles of its own. Such a chain has to take care also of broken, defective and unserviceable items. Almost 30 % of goods sold online are returned for various reasons, some as flimsy as customer not being available or simply refusing to collect the items—that is why many online sellers no longer offer ‘Cash on Delivery’ facility in a few states in India.

Reverse logistics is a demanding task in these chains as no customer is as impatient and may be irate, as an online shopper  sitting at home with an unusable item, more so if she has paid in advance.

Indian e-retailers are yet to turn profitable. While deep discounts and free-shipping will remain for some time as the e-retailers slug it out among themselves, the only other option to reduce the bleeding is to cut operating costs—which are mainly  supply chain  costs. But, again there are trade-offs at each step. To maintain high service levels, many e-retailers are building smaller warehouses in urban areas to be in vicinity of consumers, despite the high property costs, rather than having bigger warehouses in the outskirts of cities.

After adding an e-retail arm, organised retailers find themselves competing with pure e-retail companies for the online share. But they may end up cutting off their nose to spite their own face, by harming their traditional retail business. Across the globe, late entrants in the field like Wal-Mart— an apotheosis of supply chain efficiency—are finding it difficult to integrate e-retail with existing business model.
1/15/18, 19:30 - Ayotakshee: For a Hyperlocal business model to be successful, it is important to keep a tab on the changing environment, understanding the new business and choosing alliances and partners well. The supply chain must be optimised such that the product ordered is available at the right place at the right time, or else the consumer will try out a different brand.
It is also important to compare the offline, the marketplace and the hyperlocal customers, understand then, and take regular feedback.

A large nationwide retailer might require customers to order today so that they can deliver tomorrow, but a hyperlocal seller would ensure that the customer receives the his order with an hour or two. In order to make the model work, the entire supply chain is located close to both buyer as well as the seller. In many cases, the sellers are themselves retailers or smaller traders. The entire process is efficient to a certain degree since the customer knows where the product is being sourced from, where it's present location is, when it will be delivered, leading to lower information distortion. Customers want more transparency within supply chains and information about the origin of their purchases, in addition to getting products delivered same day. Hyper-local delivery sources products closer to individual customers, and this is the key to faster, cheaper delivery times, and ultimately, customer satisfaction. By eliminating as many middle layers or steps as possible, hyper-local delivery optimises performance and efficiency in logistics processes. Since hyperlocal businesses deliver in a certain area only, long distance transportation, warehousing and many other legs of logistics do not have a major impact on the supply chain. The much-famed last-mile logistics is the only logistics that the hyperlocal business needs to worry about. Last mile delivery (LMD) is the final stage in a delivery cycle when a customer receives the product in hand. 

The problem arises when the retailer needs to supply only a small amout of items (since bulk orders inherently have lower transportation costs). India however,being a country with high population density, there is little to no need for large freight; instead smaller vehicles or bikes are used, allowing the hyper-local approach to thrive.

The local delivery market is very fragmented and much lower on the IT maturity curve than other segments of the transportation industry. It is a challenge to keep control of local delivery operations, locating addresses, tracking delivery boys’ movement, real time updation of status etc, all of which impact cost and service levels. Irreliable workforce is one of the major issues in this space. Maintaining the quality of products sent by merchants and maintaining demand and supply in the locality is yet another challenge faced by the hyperlocal delivery ventures

1/16/18, 23:47 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Baby , how was flight and everything that happened afterwards ?
1/16/18, 23:48 - Ayotakshee: There were no aisle seats. I was one of the last 4 people to get their boarding passes etc. So I got a window seat (better than a stupid middle seat at least)
1/16/18, 23:48 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Middle seats are the worst , you're completely stuck
1/16/18, 23:48 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I love aisle seats toooo
1/16/18, 23:48 - Ayotakshee: Bohot stupid system tha inka. I went to a counter. They said go to the self help kiosk to get the boarding pass. So I went to one of those. Wahaan it said check in over
1/16/18, 23:49 - Ayotakshee: So I went back to the fkn desk
1/16/18, 23:49 - Ayotakshee: And it was just so much redundant werk
1/16/18, 23:49 - Ayotakshee: (Checkin on the kiosk  closes 1 hour before, so 2:15 band ho gaya tha. I tried at 2:20)
1/16/18, 23:50 - Ayotakshee: Anyway, finally got my pass etc
1/16/18, 23:50 - Ayotakshee: Security check kiya
1/16/18, 23:50 - Ayotakshee: Then seedha charging station
1/16/18, 23:50 - Ayotakshee: Wahaan I asked another dude if I can use his charger (to charge my power bank simultaneously)
1/16/18, 23:51 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Hahaha ,I asked a McDonald's lady for her charger port toooo
1/16/18, 23:51 - Ayotakshee: Thankgod I did. Because phone got charged till like 25% and with the little power bank charge 35% types
1/16/18, 23:51 - Ayotakshee: And then lasted the entire journey back home
1/16/18, 23:51 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: (I found my charger port in the back of my bag btw , turns out I didn't forget it at Vasudaa's)
1/16/18, 23:51 - Ayotakshee: I reached home with 5%

1/16/18, 23:53 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Danng
1/16/18, 23:54 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Itna dimag kharab hua figuring out charging strategies during the trip due to this

1/17/18, 00:03 - Ayotakshee: And then I saw the girl on the window seat in front of me sleeping on the middle seat dude's shoulder and middle seat dude's head on top of her head

1/17/18, 14:28 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: So I went there
1/17/18, 14:28 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: And Munawwar motioned me to come and talk
1/17/18, 14:28 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: He took me into a conference hall
1/17/18, 14:28 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Where we had a Frank discussion
1/17/18, 14:28 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: He said ki
1/17/18, 14:29 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I don't seem like I want to work on the project, like I worked on the Alexa one
1/17/18, 14:29 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: So I said
1/17/18, 14:29 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: That's it was very irritating for me as I can't really code anything if these internet issues are not resolved
1/17/18, 14:30 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: So we've been having a lot of these issues as they have blocked out a lot of websites
1/17/18, 14:30 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: So I can't install libraries and stuff to make my project run
1/17/18, 14:30 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: So this past week I just sat free as I could tell do anything
1/17/18, 14:30 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: And Munawwar couldn't help
1/17/18, 14:30 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: As he was in a meeting
1/17/18, 14:30 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: So Munawwar said ki you seem to have stopped trying
1/17/18, 14:31 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I said that , logistical issues see I couldn't get any work done
1/17/18, 14:31 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Which was not my fault at all
1/17/18, 14:31 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: So he said , ki you k ow that this is hsbc
1/17/18, 14:31 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: And problems like these keep happening
1/17/18, 14:31 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Regardless of where you are etc
1/17/18, 14:31 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: So I said yeah
1/17/18, 14:32 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: And he said do you want to work on this project ?
1/17/18, 14:32 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: So there's two projects one for the web and one for android
1/17/18, 14:32 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: And I personally prefer the web
1/17/18, 14:32 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: So I said see , I can work for anything
1/17/18, 14:32 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: But if I had to make a preference list
1/17/18, 14:32 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I would say the web project is first personally
1/17/18, 14:33 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: So he said ki , acha
1/17/18, 14:33 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: You know , since you're not liking it at all
1/17/18, 14:33 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I've transferred you to the web project
1/17/18, 14:33 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: But I'll have to work on both of the projects , the Android one too
1/17/18, 14:33 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: For a bit

1/28/18, 23:48 - Ayotakshee: Singhvi however, is a different ball game altogether
1/28/18, 23:49 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: He sounds like a bully
1/28/18, 23:49 - Ayotakshee: Kinda is
1/28/18, 23:49 - Ayotakshee: But we're terrified of getting kicked out of his class
1/28/18, 23:49 - Ayotakshee: So kinda have to adhere to it

1/28/18, 23:49 - Ayotakshee: Yes bu

1/28/18, 23:50 - Ayotakshee: I think he's overrated
1/28/18, 23:51 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Why
1/28/18, 23:51 - Ayotakshee: Because I don't feel any great enlightenment
1/28/18, 23:51 - Ayotakshee: He's just really really strict and all
1/28/18, 23:51 - Ayotakshee: And his methodology is different
1/28/18, 23:51 - Ayotakshee: But I'm giving it time, till the end of the term. To see if I learn something fruitful from the course
1/28/18, 23:51 - Ayotakshee: Because I haven't till now
1/28/18, 23:52 - Ayotakshee: So yeah, I think we've just built him up a lot in our heads
1/28/18, 23:52 - Ayotakshee: Anywayy, after dinner, went for SAWC meeting. There was a lot of stuff revolving around farewell etc that we had to discuss
1/28/18, 23:52 - Ayotakshee: That went on till 10:30ish

2/4/18, 12:54 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I'm not mad baby, sorry , I am just a bit irritated by your friends falling for you and feeling the need to tell you about it , like it's going to change anything.
2/4/18, 12:54 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: That must have snuck in somehow
2/4/18, 12:54 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I'm sorry bub
2/4/18, 12:54 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Yeah I know I knoww
2/4/18, 12:54 - Ayotakshee: I'm sorry this happened
2/4/18, 12:54 - Ayotakshee: I need to figure out if I'm doing something wrong here
2/4/18, 12:55 - Ayotakshee: I'll think about it achhe se, bub. Because I don't want things like this to affect our relationship
2/4/18, 12:56 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Naah it's okay bub
2/4/18, 12:56 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: It's my fault , I'll figure out how to keep the irritation at bay
2/4/18, 12:56 - Ayotakshee: No baby
2/4/18, 12:56 - Ayotakshee: Don't do that
2/4/18, 12:56 - Ayotakshee: I need to know if something is bothering you
2/4/18, 12:57 - Ayotakshee: You were laughing on the phone so much yesterday, I didn't realise it got to you
2/4/18, 13:35 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Of course it'll get to me, Ayo
2/4/18, 13:35 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: But not too much
2/4/18, 13:35 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I'm not angry or anything
2/4/18, 13:35 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Just a little irritated
2/4/18, 13:36 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Sorry , was talking to my mom
2/4/18, 15:03 - Ayotakshee: You just need to tell me. I'd want to know if something is bothering you
2/4/18, 15:04 - Ayotakshee: I know it would get to you of course but you can tell me bub. And if something isn't cool with you I would want to know that too
2/4/18, 15:04 - Ayotakshee: And don't say something like this. Because if you keep irritation at bay I'll never know that you got irritated
2/4/18, 15:06 - Ayotakshee: I'm not there, I can't see you, i can't see your face. I don't know what's going through your head. So you need to tell me
2/4/18, 15:06 - Ayotakshee: That's all I'm saying
2/4/18, 15:07 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Okay bub , I just don't want you to have another issue on your hands to worry about me too now . You're already under so much pressure toh the assignments and iske upar Viraj Wala scene bhi.
2/4/18, 15:07 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I get it bub, I'm sorry for that
2/4/18, 15:08 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: You know na , ki I will tell you everything eventually
2/4/18, 15:08 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I can't hide stuff from you
2/4/18, 15:08 - Ayotakshee: I don't want to know eventually
2/4/18, 15:09 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Yes baby , I know .
2/4/18, 15:09 - Ayotakshee: What's the point if I find out 2 days later that you got mad at something
2/4/18, 15:10 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Matlab I didn't think too much about it yesterday , today since I had time to digest it , I had a bit of a slightly off mood
2/4/18, 15:11 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I hate even the idea of any other guy with you , so I guess I got a little sadish , I won't even say mad
2/4/18, 15:11 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: But I'm really okay bubba
2/4/18, 15:11 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I swear
2/4/18, 15:12 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: P.S : I mean another with you , I meant in a dating sense. I have no problem with you having guy friends babe .
2/4/18, 15:13 - Ayotakshee: I know you're okay. I'm just annoyed with you. Because you're going and writing things like this after that
2/4/18, 15:14 - Ayotakshee: You are my number one priority. It is my job to worry about you or what you're thinking
2/4/18, 15:15 - Ayotakshee: You're the one person that trumps singhvi viraj everything. If something is bothering you, it will kill me not knowing about it
2/4/18, 15:17 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I'm okay bub
2/4/18, 15:17 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: I won't be a burden though
2/4/18, 15:19 - Ayotakshee: You're not a burden.
2/4/18, 15:24 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: Okay
2/4/18, 15:25 - Ayotakshee: You're the only thing that keeps me going. I need to know what's going through your head. Don't think that by not telling me your thoughts you're keeping me from unnecessary troubles. You may be right, if I don't know I probably won't be troubled. But I'd hate finding out later
2/4/18, 15:26 - Ayotakshee: I'm sorry. I'm making this a big deal. Let's chuck it
2/4/18, 15:26 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: No baby , I get it
2/4/18, 15:26 - Karanbir Singh Chahal: And I feel the same you know that right ?
